Dice Game
This project is a simple, two-player dice game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

Game Rules
Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
On each turn, the player can roll the die as many times as they like, adding the result to their current score.
If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all the points accumulated for that turn.
Players can choose to "hold" their score, adding it to their total score and ending their turn.
The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
