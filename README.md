# Dice Game

This project is a simple two-player dice game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Live Demo
You can play the game here: [Dice Game]([https://dice-game-jmpsbvqyx-shvngsris-projects.vercel.app/](https://dice-game-nine-indol.vercel.app/))

## Game Rules
- Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
- If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all the points accumulated during that turn.
- Players can choose to **Hold** their current score. Holding adds their accumulated points to their total score and switches the turn to the other player.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

### Controls
- **Roll Dice**: Roll the die and accumulate points for the turn unless a 1 is rolled.
- **Hold**: Save the current turn's score to the total and pass the turn to the next player.
- **New Game**: Start a fresh game.

Enjoy the game!
